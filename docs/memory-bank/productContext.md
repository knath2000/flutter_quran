# Product Context: Flutter macOS Task Manager

## 1. Problem Space

Developers and potentially other users need a visually engaging and efficient way to manage software projects and associated tasks (features, bugs, chores) directly on their macOS desktop. Existing tools might lack the desired level of visual flair, animation, or a specific workflow.

## 2. Target Audience

*   Primary: Software developers using macOS.
*   Secondary: Individuals looking for a highly visual and interactive task/project management tool on macOS.

## 3. How It Should Work (Vision)

*   **Core Loop:** Users can easily view a dashboard overview, browse projects, view tasks within projects, and add/edit/manage both projects and tasks. Data is stored in Cloud Firestore, replacing the previous local storage (Drift/localStorage).
*   **Interaction:** The application should feel highly interactive and responsive, with animations providing feedback and enhancing the user experience. The UI aims for a unique, "game-like" aesthetic rather than mimicking standard macOS applications.
*   **Workflow:** Focused on managing project lifecycles and task statuses (e.g., To Do, Debug, Add Feature, Done). Data is stored in Cloud Firestore, associated with the authenticated user via Firebase Authentication. This replaces previous local storage and enables cloud sync.

## 4. User Experience Goals

*   **Engaging:** The UI should be visually stimulating and enjoyable to interact with, leveraging color, animation, and custom design.
*   **Unique:** Provide a distinct user experience compared to typical productivity apps.
*   **Efficient:** Despite the visual complexity, core task management functions should remain intuitive and quick to access.
*   **Fluid:** Animations and transitions should feel smooth and natural, enhancing rather than hindering usability.
