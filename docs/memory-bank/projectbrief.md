# Project Brief: Flutter macOS Task Manager

## 1. Core Goal

To develop a feature-rich project and task management application specifically for macOS using the Flutter framework.

## 2. Key Characteristics

*   **Target Platforms:** macOS, iOS, Web.
*   **UI/UX:** Highly unique, colorful, complex, and heavily animated user experience. Aims for a "game-like" feel, distinct from standard macOS conventions.
*   **Core Functionality:** Allow users to add/manage current and future projects, and add/manage tasks (categorized as to-be-completed, debugged, added features) within those projects.

## 3. Initial Scope (Basic UI Structure)

*   Establish foundational UI structure.
*   Implement core views: Dashboard, Project List, Task Details.
*   Focus on implementing the unique visual style and heavy animation strategy from the outset.
*   Define and implement core navigation flow between views with custom animated transitions.

## 4. Non-Goals (Initially)

*   Data persistence: **Implemented** using Cloud Firestore for all platforms (replaced previous Drift/localStorage approach).
*   User authentication: Optional Firebase Authentication being implemented.
*   Advanced features beyond basic project/task CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
