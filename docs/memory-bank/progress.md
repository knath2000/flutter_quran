# Progress (as of commit 770bd6c)

## What Works (Estimated)

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Basic Surah selection screen (`SurahSelectionScreen`).
- ✅ Basic Quran reader screen (`QuranReaderScreen`) displaying verses from local JSON.
- ✅ Loading Quran text data from `assets/data/quran_arabic_text.json`.
- ✅ Basic UI structure and navigation (likely using GoRouter).
- ✅ Basic theme setup (`AppTheme`).

### Web Platform
- ✅ Initial Vercel deployment setup (likely using `build.sh` and dashboard config).
- ✅ Basic web build output generation.

## In Progress (Estimated)

- **Vercel Deployment:** Stabilizing and refining the deployment process via `build.sh` and dashboard settings.
- **Quran Reader UI:** Enhancing the reader screen UI/UX.
- **State Management:** Implementing or refining Riverpod providers for data handling.

## What's Left to Build (Major items from original plan)

- **Pagination:** Implementing verse pagination in the reader screen.
- **Audio Playback:** Adding audio playback functionality for verses.
- **User Progress/Gamification:** Features like tracking reading progress, badges, etc.
- **Settings:** Implementing user-configurable settings.
- **Data Persistence:** Moving beyond local JSON if needed (e.g., user data).
- **Authentication:** Adding user authentication.
- **Advanced Features:** Search, bookmarks, notes, etc.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, widget, and integration tests.
- **Platform Enhancements:** PWA features, macOS specific improvements (signing, DMG).

## Known Issues (Estimated)

- **Scrolling:** Potential scrolling issues in the `QuranReaderScreen` if the number of verses is large (this was likely the state before pagination was attempted).
- **Vercel Build:** The build/deployment process might still be fragile or require specific environment setup.
- **Performance:** Initial load time or performance with large Surahs might be suboptimal.
- **State Management:** Potential complexities or inefficiencies in the early Riverpod setup.

*(Note: This progress reflects the estimated state after resetting to commit `770bd6c`. Features like Firestore integration, advanced PWA/macOS support, pagination, and audio playback mentioned previously are not present in this version.)*
