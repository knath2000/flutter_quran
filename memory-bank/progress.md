# Progress: Quran Adventures (Phase 4/5 In Progress)

## 1. What Works

*   Project planning complete.
*   Initial Memory Bank documentation established.
*   **Phase 1: Setup & Foundation completed:** (Details omitted)
*   **Phase 2: Core Content & Audio (Basic Implementation Completed):** (Details omitted)
*   **Phase 3: UI Polish & Basic Animations Completed:** (Details omitted)
*   **Phase 4/5: Settings Logic & Gamification Foundation:**
    *   Settings persistence implemented using `SharedPreferencesService`.
    *   Settings screen UI connected to providers for toggles, font size, and reciter selection.
    *   `UserProgress` model includes points, badges, streak data, and completed verses.
    *   Hive persistence implemented for `UserProgress`.
    *   Points awarded on verse playback completion.
    *   Points and Streak displayed in `SurahSelectionScreen` AppBar.
    *   `Badge` model defined with examples.
    *   Logic added to award 'first_verse', 'surah_fatiha_complete', and 'ten_verses' badges.
    *   Placeholder `BadgesScreen` created with route and navigation.
    *   Streak update logic implemented and called on provider init.
    *   Logic added to mark verses as completed and trigger badge checks.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **Phase 3 Remainder (Refinement):**
    *   Refine error handling and loading states in UI.
    *   Add basic tests.
    *   Refine existing animations (e.g., `StarryBackground`, transitions).
    *   Implement the visual progress map/journey concept for Surah selection.
*   **Phase 4: Advanced Animations & Engagement (Remaining):**
    *   Integrate Rive/Lottie animations (requires assets).
*   **Phase 5: Gamification Layer (Remaining):**
    *   Implement logic for awarding other badges (e.g., streak milestones).
    *   Refine badge display UI (`BadgesScreen`).
*   Phase 6: Platform Tuning & Testing
*   Phase 7: Beta & Release

## 3. Current Status

*   **Overall:** In Progress - Phase 4/5 (Advanced Animations & Gamification).
*   **Current Phase:** Implemented persistence and core logic for settings and user progress (points, badges, streaks, verse completion).
*   **Blockers:** Need Rive/Lottie assets. Need to finalize API/font/reciter choices. Need specific rules for badges/streaks.

## 4. Known Issues

*   API endpoints and editions in code are examples and need confirmation.
*   Error handling in UI is basic.
*   Settings screen logic for reciter list source needs implementation (currently hardcoded).
*   Audio playback is basic (no progress, state handling, or sync yet).
*   No tests written yet.
*   `StarryBackground` animation performance on lower-end devices untested.
*   Streak update logic in `UserProgressNotifier` is only called on provider init, not necessarily on app resume yet (requires listening to AppLifecycleState).
