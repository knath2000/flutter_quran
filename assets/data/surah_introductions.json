Despite\u00a0this, many\u00a0among\u00a0the People\u00a0of the\u00a0Book and\u00a0the polytheists\u00a0refused to\u00a0depart from\u00a0their ways\u00a0until the clear proof was given. Those\u00a0who disbelieve\u00a0among them\u00a0face a\u00a0severe punishment, while\u00a0those who\u00a0believe and\u00a0do righteous\u00a0deeds will\u00a0have their\u00a0rewards with\u00a0their Lord. The\u00a0surah\u00a0emphasizes the\u00a0simplicity of\u00a0the core\u00a0message of\u00a0Islam, which is\u00a0to worship\u00a0Allah and\u00a0maintain purity\u00a0in faith.\n\nSURAH\u00a099: Az-Zalzalah\u00a0(The Earthquake)\nAz-Zalzalah describes\u00a0the final\u00a0earthquake that\u00a0shakes\u00a0the earth, causing it\u00a0to throw\u00a0up its burdens. People will\u00a0be seen\u00a0scattered, and each\u00a0soul will\u00a0then\u00a0understand\u00a0what it\u00a0has put\u00a0forward. This short\u00a0surah\u00a0vividly\u00a0portrays the\u00a0chaos and\u00a0the ultimate\u00a0accountability on\u00a0the Day\u00a0of Judgment, reminding\u00a0people that\u00a0even\u00a0the\u00a0smallest actions\u00a0are significant\u00a0and will\u00a0be shown, whether they are\u00a0as small\u00a0as a\u00a0mustard seed.\n\nSURAH 100: Al-Adiyat\u00a0(The Chargers)\nAl-Adiyat\u00a0swears\u00a0by the\u00a0charging war\u00a0horses, creating a\u00a0vivid scene\u00a0of battle\u00a0and\u00a0strife. The\u00a0surah\u00a0reflects on\u00a0the ingratitude of\u00a0man towards\u00a0his Lord\u00a0and his\u00a0intense love\u00a0of wealth. It\u00a0warns that\u00a0man's\u00a0actions are\u00a0witnessed by\u00a0Allah, and the\u00a0violent love\u00a0of riches\u00a0often leads\u00a0to conflict\u00a0and destruction. The\u00a0chapter serves\u00a0as a\u00a0reminder\u00a0of the consequences\u00a0of unchecked\u00a0desires and\u00a0the importance\u00a0of gratitude\u00a0towards Allah.\n\nSURAH\u00a0101: Al-Qari'ah\u00a0(The\u00a0Calamity)\nAl-Qari'ah\u00a0describes the\u00a0Day of\u00a0Judgment as\u00a0a\u00a0striking\u00a0calamity, where people are\u00a0scattered like\u00a0moths\u00a0and the\u00a0mountains like\u00a0carded\u00a0wool. The surah presents\u00a0a scale\u00a0of justice": null, " those\u00a0whose good\u00a0deeds weigh\u00a0heavy will\u00a0be in\u00a0a pleasing\u00a0life, while those\u00a0whose scale\u00a0is light\u00a0will\u00a0find their abode in\u00a0Al-Hawiyah\u00a0(the Abyss). It\u00a0emphasizes the\u00a0transient nature\u00a0of worldly\u00a0life and\u00a0the lasting\u00a0impact of\u00a0deeds in\u00a0the Hereafter.\n\nSURAH\u00a0102: At-Takathur\u00a0(The\u00a0Rivalry in\u00a0World Increase)\nAt-Takathur\u00a0warns against\u00a0the distraction\u00a0caused\u00a0by\u00a0the desire to accumulate\u00a0worldly things. The\u00a0surah\u00a0criticizes\u00a0people for\u00a0their mutual\u00a0rivalry in\u00a0piling\u00a0up worldly\u00a0possessions, which diverts them\u00a0until they\u00a0visit the\u00a0graves. It reminds\u00a0them that\u00a0they will\u00a0soon know\u00a0the reality\u00a0of the\u00a0life\u00a0to\u00a0come, suggesting\u00a0that\u00a0true\u00a0success\u00a0lies\u00a0in\u00a0preparing\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Hereafter\u00a0rather\u00a0than\u00a0being\u00a0engrossed in temporary\u00a0worldly\u00a0gains.\n\nSURAH\u00a0103: Al-Asr\u00a0(The Declining\u00a0Day)\nAl-Asr, one of\u00a0the shortest\u00a0surahs, captures the\u00a0essence of\u00a0human loss\u00a0through the\u00a0passage of\u00a0time. It asserts\u00a0that by\u00a0the token\u00a0of time, all\u00a0humans are\u00a0in loss\u00a0except those\u00a0who have\u00a0faith, do righteous\u00a0deeds, and advise\u00a0each other\u00a0to truth\u00a0and patience. This\u00a0surah\u00a0is a\u00a0powerful reminder\u00a0that success\u00a0lies in\u00a0faith, good deeds, truthful\u00a0interaction, and perseverance.\n\nSURAH\u00a0114: An-Nas\u00a0(Mankind)\nAn-Nas\u00a0is a\u00a0prayer for\u00a0protection from\u00a0the whisperings of\u00a0Satan among\u00a0men and jinn. It\u00a0invokes\u00a0the\u00a0Lord of\u00a0mankind, the King\u00a0of mankind, the\u00a0God of\u00a0mankind, to shield\u00a0against the\u00a0evil whisperer who\u00a0withdraws upon\u00a0His remembrance. This\u00a0surah\u00a0encapsulates\u00a0the constant\u00a0human need\u00a0for Allah's protection\u00a0against the\u00a0unseen evils\u00a0that\u00a0pervade earthly\u00a0life, emphasizing reliance\u00a0on the\u00a0Almighty.": null}
